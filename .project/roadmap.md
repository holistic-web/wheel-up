## Roadmap
- use Vue.js with our chrome extension to allow us to use npm components
- build a web app to allow a greater control than the extension providedes, perhaps the extension simply loads a simplified view of the webpage
- publish the chrome extension such that it can be downloaded from the chrome web store
