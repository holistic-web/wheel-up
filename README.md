# Youtube Wheel-Up
A chrome extension to enable a user to 'wheel-up' a song playing on youtube.

It is currently in the initial phase of development. More to come shortly. We are following the standards outlined by google [here](https://developers.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted)

## Architecture
- `[/manifest.json](/manifest.json): [Every extension has a JSON-formatted manifest file, named manifest.json, that provides important information.](https://developers.chrome.com/extensions/manifest)
- `[/background.js](/background.js): [Extensions monitor events in their background script, then react with specified instructions.](https://developers.chrome.com/extensions/background_pages)
